Laravel is a PHP framework for modern web apps. It's one of the most popular PHP frameworks, and coders love it's elegance and stability. It has great built-in support for routing, sessions, modular templates, email, data validation, and so much more. But all that power means it's sometimes hard to know where to get started.

This course is designed to give you a headstart on building your own Laravel website. It provides beginner level knowledge on all the basics, including routing, views, sessions, validation, e-mails, and more. From the absolute basics of creating static pages with Blade all the way through to building and validating a contact form that sends e-mails. So let's get started!


## Source Files Description:

The source of this course is quite simple since we've only added and modified a few files. The **routes/web.php** file contains all of the routing, and the views are stored in the **resources/views** folder.

If you're following along with the course and would like to use the same template then refer to the **templates** folder.
